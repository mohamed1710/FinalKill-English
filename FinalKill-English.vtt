00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.058
What kinda medication?

2
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.110
Prozac.

3
00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:52.485
- What?
- Prozac.

4
00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.020
No, I heard you
the first time.

5
00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.813
Why the hell do you
wanna give me Prozac?

6
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.218
It'll stabilize your mood
and mke you feel better.

7
00:01:57.242 --> 00:01:59.234
Well, how's it gonna do that?

8
00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:02.074
It prevents the reuptake
of serotonin in your brain,

9
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.911
so serotonin levels rise, and
that tends to stabilize mood.

10
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.353
That's how that works.
- Oh, for Christ sakes.

11
00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.460
Nothing can be easy with
you shrinks, can it?

12
00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.209
- Look...
- You know what?

13
00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.341
People come in here and
they spend, what, $200

14
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:16.487
thinking that
you're gonna unlock

15
00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.093
some superpower in their soul

16
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.175
so they can go home and
fuck their wives better

17
00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.010
or discover some new courage

18
00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.267
to finally admit to
themselves that they're gay.

19
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.177
Or maybe, how about this one,

20
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.957
stop draining their husband's
bank account based on the fact

21
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.722
that they think
that he's fucking

22
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:32.108
probably one of your other
clients, and what do you do?

23
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.984
You prescribe them some pills?

24
00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.065
Ha!

25
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.031
You know what that's called?

26
00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:36.946
That's called a racket.

27
00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:38.610
I beg your pardon.

28
00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.094
No, I should be begging
you for 200 bucks back!

29
00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.905
Christ on a cross.

30
00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.070
Thank god there's no
problems with my,

31
00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.954
you know.

32
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.662
Lord knows what kinda pills
you'd wanna give me for that.

33
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.872
- Mr. Rome.
- Mickey.

34
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:51.921
Mickey.

35
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.627
I have asked you numerous times

36
00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:57.133
what it is you do for a living

37
00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.965
that's causing so
much of this anxiety.

38
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.720
I already told you.

39
00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:05.509
You told me that you
occasionally transport things.

40
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.971
Yeah, yeah,
something like that.

41
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.761
Something like what?

42
00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:10.875
You know, I take things
from one place to the next.

43
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.481
I protect stuff.

44
00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:14.267
- You protect stuff.
- Sure.

45
00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:16.655
Uh-huh.

46
00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:18.146
Give me an example.

47
00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.814
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

48
00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.653
Doc, you can't
ask me questions.

49
00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.409
That is my job.

50
00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.287
No, apparently your job is
prescribing people crazy pills!

51
00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:27.412
Not crazy pills.

52
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.333
They are crazy pills, okay?

53
00:03:28.334 --> 00:03:29.494
And I'm not crazy!

54
00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:30.954
Mr. Rome...

55
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.618
Mickey, answer me
this, at least this:

56
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.207
Do you have a stressful job?

57
00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.338
Sure.

58
00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:37.999
All right, now enlighten me.

59
00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.591
What is it about that
job that is so stressful?

60
00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:49.518
Some jobs just seem to be a
little bit harder, that's all.

61
00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.272
Like this last
one, for instance.

62
00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.807
Stay low.

63
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.776
Stay low behind me, okay?

64
00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:56.777
All right.

65
00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.029
Get down, get down!

66
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.314
Get down!

67
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.498
Listen.

68
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.332
Listen to me!

69
00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:12.916
Hey, listen!

70
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.372
On the count of three,

71
00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:15.606
you're gonna get
behind me, all right?

72
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.746
Okay, on three.

73
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.086
Ready?

74
00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:20.967
Here we go.

75
00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.551
One.

76
00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:24.800
Three.

77
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.214
Let's go!

78
00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.182
Move, move, move,
move, move, move!

79
00:04:27.184 --> 00:04:28.184
Stay low, stay low!

80
00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:33.976
Down, down, down, down, down!

81
00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.728
Shit.

82
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.950
Dammit, man!

83
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:48.486
Who the hell are you?!

84
00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:51.489
What?!

85
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.622
Who the hell are you?!

86
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.579
Mitch, shut the fuck up!

87
00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.023
Why are you getting
involved with this?!

88
00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.458
Just give me the girl!

89
00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:00.419
It's my job, asshole!

90
00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:01.467
Dammit!

91
00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.324
Yeah, I shoulda
never took this job.

92
00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:07.450
I didn't wanna take this job.

93
00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:08.840
Shit.

94
00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.599
Calm down, all right?

95
00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:11.644
Breathe, just breathe.

96
00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.097
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

97
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.182
We're gonna be fine.

98
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.023
Everything's gonna be fine.

99
00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:16.730
Hey, asshole!

100
00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:18.336
I didn't wanna take this
fucking job to begin with

101
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.318
and I don't even like
these goddamn people!

102
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.651
I got a deal for ya!

103
00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.278
I keep the girl,
you go home alive.

104
00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.689
How about that?

105
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:25.615
Sounds like a good
deal, doesn't it?

106
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:26.903
Fuck your deal!

107
00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:28.739
Look, man, just give me the girl

108
00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:31.154
and you can go on
your merry way!

109
00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.206
No!

110
00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.992
You motherfucker!

111
00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:41.706
Don't move, okay?

112
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:42.819
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

113
00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:43.843
Stay there.

114
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.281
Asshole!

115
00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.033
Drop the gun.

116
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.620
Drop the gun.

117
00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:21.171
Come here.

118
00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:34.721
Go ahead, do it.

119
00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.681
You stupid bastard.

120
00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:46.572
Mickey.

121
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.114
What?

122
00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.947
You were gonna tell me
about that last job you did

123
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.361
and how hard it was for you.

124
00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:56.748
Oh.

125
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.750
Sorry, doc.

126
00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.870
Job ain't what it used to be.

127
00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:04.630
Well, age has an
effect on all of us.

128
00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.210
Who said anything about age?

129
00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.716
I was just trying
to make light.

130
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.468
You know, a guy
like me comes in here,

131
00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:12.050
you just reiterate the same
shit that comes outta my mouth.

132
00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.930
Some profession you got.
- Excuse me.

133
00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:16.718
Oh look, here, a master's
degree in bullshit!

134
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.306
- Excuse me!
- More bullshit.

135
00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.017
Pfft, that's horseshit.
- Feel better?

136
00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.751
You're lucky I'm not a
depressed son of a bitch.

137
00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:23.085
I just might've thought
of taking a header

138
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.566
off a goddamn skyscraper

139
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.568
or played leapfrog
into oncoming traffic.

140
00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.945
I hope you're not telling me

141
00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.008
you have a plan
to hurt yourself.

142
00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.489
But I will tell you this:

143
00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:31.594
At very least, you
have an anger problem.

144
00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:32.950
Why would you say that?

145
00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.656
You have a very,
very short fuse.

146
00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.663
Short fuse, what is
that, some type of analogy?

147
00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.290
You know what, Doc,
this psychotherapy shit,

148
00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:41.167
it ain't working.

149
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.501
Psychiatry.

150
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:43.911
Whatever.

151
00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:45.191
Do you want the
medication or not?

152
00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:46.251
Screw the pills!

153
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.915
I don't know what your job is,

154
00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.487
but it's having a terrible
effect on your psyche

155
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.003
and your body, and it
could just kill ya.

156
00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:54.638
Thank you, Dr. Obvous!

157
00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.383
Mr. Rome, how good
it is to see you again.

158
00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.298
No need for the
meet-and-greet, Chloe.

159
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.808
Mr. Reiser will
be with you shortly.

160
00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.094
Deacon's in the other room.

161
00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:43.138
I do believe you know him.

162
00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.055
I do know who he is

163
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.188
and I don't need an introduction,
thank you very much.

164
00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.575
Deacon, how the hell
are you doin', buddy?

165
00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:01.659
Hey!

166
00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.495
Still tracking the numbers

167
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.455
and still getting
interrupted by you, Rome.

168
00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:06.664
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.670
Any idea why Carl wants me here?

170
00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:12.049
Hey, before you answer
that, how those hands doing?

171
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:15.006
You beat new information
outta anybody lately?

172
00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.593
I'm sure it's something
very important to the agency.

173
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.640
Oh, I'm sure.

174
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.016
We do give you the tough jobs.

175
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:24.146
Yeah.

176
00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.685
Never seen you with
your head so low, Mick.

177
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:30.768
Had a rough week, pal.

178
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.982
Yeah, well, nobody
said this job was easy.

179
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:34.863
Hell, nobody in this
business wants to work,

180
00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.024
but somebody's gotta do it.

181
00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.783
Yeah, I guess you're right.

182
00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:41.116
Speaking of which, where
is that little shit Paulie?

183
00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.433
You got him working
around here somewhere

184
00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.164
sweeping up trash?

185
00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:45.936
Because I haven't seen that
asshole in a hot minute.

186
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.451
Wait.

187
00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:49.621
Please tell me that
you finally fired him.

188
00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.834
Nah, Carl's got him
working on a different gig.

189
00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:53.294
Guy's built like
a brick house,

190
00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.209
but he's got brains
like an outhouse.

191
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.593
Plus, every time I think of him,

192
00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.379
the word prick
comes up in my mind.

193
00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.889
Yeah, you never
did like him much.

194
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:02.345
You don't like him either.

195
00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:03.996
Reiser will have you
both on a job real soon,

196
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.682
I'm sure of it.

197
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.583
You're both really good
at your individual assets.

198
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.566
Don't put your money on me
working with that creeper.

199
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.397
How's he looking these days?

200
00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.256
He's wearing his
mustache just like Reiser.

201
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.691
- Get the hell outta here!
- Yup.

202
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.948
Son of a bitch.

203
00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.530
Mr. Rome, Mr. Reiser
will see you now.

204
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.866
One more thing, Deacon.

205
00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:26.157
This business front
you got going on,

206
00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.700
these secretaries are strippers.

207
00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.368
They're referred to
as dancers, Mickey.

208
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.457
Whatever makes you sleep
better at night, pal.

209
00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:34.089
And I have never shaken
my ass for dollar bills.

210
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:38.298
And I shave my head
because it's aerodynamic.

211
00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:39.427
See ya, Deac!

212
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.516
How ya doin', Paulie?

213
00:10:48.565 --> 00:10:50.126
Oh my goodness, Mickey,
I'm doing amazing.

214
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.516
Oh yeah; doesn't look like it.

215
00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.059
- Doesn't?
- No, you look like shit.

216
00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:54.522
Oh.

217
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.048
That's so crazy,
because I am so crisp

218
00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:57.654
and you look like
you're a hundred.

219
00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.190
Don't touch,
don't touch, okay?

220
00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.323
Yeah, you got it.

221
00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:01.200
How's work?

222
00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:02.036
Work is fine.

223
00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.493
- It is?
- Yeah.

224
00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:04.974
Seems like you're
having a tough time.

225
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.142
I hate your guts.
- Okay, good.

226
00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.532
You're like herpes.

227
00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:08.984
You go away, but
then you come back.

228
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.337
Goddamn.

229
00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:16.374
God, you look old
as fuck.

230
00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:20.044
Hey.

231
00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.712
How are ya?

232
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:25.132
Sorry I'm not shaking
hands, still a little wet.

233
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:27.644
Look at this.

234
00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.145
See that?

235
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.190
Chloe!

236
00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.773
I appreciate your authenticity,

237
00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.561
but can you get me a real
fucking chair, please?

238
00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:39.730
We clear $100,000 a month.

239
00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:42.240
My office is a porno
set, basically.

240
00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.610
Price of running a front.

241
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.580
Glamorous.

242
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.373
So, what's going on?

243
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:51.954
Last one was a tough one?

244
00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:53.619
Aren't they all?

245
00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:55.287
I mean, you saved
her, didn't you?

246
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.067
Saved her life; she's got
you to thank for that.

247
00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.673
Well, it's my job, right?

248
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.254
You tell me what to do

249
00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:01.864
and then I go and try
and make that happen?

250
00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.175
No, you don't
try, you succeed.

251
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.007
You're the best
specialist I have.

252
00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.265
I mean, you got a
perfect track record.

253
00:12:10.313 --> 00:12:12.396
You run protection
like nobody else.

254
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.726
Yeah, well, it wasn't easy.

255
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.357
But this last one...

256
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.361
Got to your head?

257
00:12:16.362 --> 00:12:17.278
No, she coulda died.

258
00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:18.735
They all coulda died.

259
00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.882
That's the name of the game.
- No, look,

260
00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.363
this one was different, okay?

261
00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:22.426
She's young, she ha her
whole life ahead of her,

262
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.157
and for what?

263
00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.721
Because her daddy saw something
that he wasn't supposed to,

264
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.452
now she becomes a target?

265
00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:30.080
This fucking
world that we live in, man.

266
00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:31.831
Look, Carl, that's it.

267
00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:32.876
It's over, I'm done.

268
00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:35.210
No, I know.

269
00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:38.123
I heard you put
in for retirement.

270
00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.917
I can't live with myself
if someone dies on my watch.

271
00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.426
It's not in me.

272
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.211
Well, you got a
lot to retire on.

273
00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.177
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

274
00:12:47.225 --> 00:12:49.638
You got bonds, CDs,
you got Treasuries,

275
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:50.847
not to mention the cash.

276
00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:54.898
Whatchu gonna do?

277
00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.111
I don't know.

278
00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.318
Move somewhere with palm
trees, white sand beaches.

279
00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:07.660
Drink one of them fruity
drinks outta those coconuts

280
00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.445
with the umbrella
sticking out of it.

281
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.863
I don't know, maybe
I can do that.

282
00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.781
Yeah, that sounds
like paradise.

283
00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:18.245
I got one more for ya.

284
00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.756
- No, Carl, come on, no.
- Please, just one.

285
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.986
Just one...
- Carl, come on, no.

286
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.593
Listen, hey, I can't.

287
00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.048
I can't.
- You can drink

288
00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.537
all the fruity drinks
you want after.

289
00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.142
Please.

290
00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:36.064
What is it?

291
00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:38.102
Husband and wife.

292
00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.484
Husband was an accountant
for the Fratelli family...

293
00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:41.964
Oh god, I know
where this is going.

294
00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.071
Stole $8 million and
he bailed with the wife.

295
00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.152
Where's the agency on this?

296
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.736
They wanna turn
state's evidence.

297
00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.117
They came to me for protection

298
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.528
while the FBI
sorts out its shit.

299
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.682
Well, where'd you put him?

300
00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:52.891
Safe house, Central America.

301
00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:54.372
- Central America?
- Yeah.

302
00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.811
Where they behead you
with chainsaws and shit?

303
00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:57.396
Don't they send your
head back to your mother

304
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.628
and then put your body
up in telephone wires?

305
00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.108
I'm not going there!
- You're thinking Mexico.

306
00:14:01.132 --> 00:14:02.919
No, it's not Mexico.

307
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.945
They got cockaroaches the
size of squirrels down there!

308
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:05.801
What the fuck
are you talking about?

309
00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:06.919
And snakes.

310
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.587
Goddamn snakes.

311
00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:09.992
You ever watch that
National Geographic channel?

312
00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:13.384
They got those poisonous
arrow frog things.

313
00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.177
Send Paulie Walnuts down there!

314
00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:17.471
He likes crocodiles,
gloom, and death!

315
00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:23.401
They got palm trees.

316
00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:25.654
Get out of my
office, all right?

317
00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.314
Your flight leaves
in the morning.

318
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:29.803
How easy you say
this job is gonna be?

319
00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.489
Easy, easy-peasy.

320
00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.278
No one knows where they're at

321
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.975
and the safe house is equipped
with all the necessities

322
00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.661
you're gonna need for
propery protection.

323
00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.120
Big house?

324
00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:38.961
Big enough.

325
00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:40.202
Pool?

326
00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.665
Yeah, they got a pool.

327
00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.025
They got a pool with
a view of the sea.

328
00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.790
You got a pool and the sea!

329
00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:46.378
You can see the sea!

330
00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:48.187
I got boots on
the ground over there?

331
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.615
You got an assistant who'll
take care of everything.

332
00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.005
Clean water?

333
00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.117
Jesus Christ, you
got ADD, you know that?

334
00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:54.133
You got ADD and you're neurotic.

335
00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:55.371
What are these two cats like?

336
00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:56.931
Who, the husband and wife?

337
00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:58.811
No, Laurel and Hardy.

338
00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:03.351
The husband is scared and
the wife is a pain in the ass.

339
00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:05.153
She's a wife, what?

340
00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.550
Look, all you gotta do,
sit on 'em, have a whiskey,

341
00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.315
put a fuckin' umbrella
in your whiskey

342
00:15:10.368 --> 00:15:13.486
and wait 'til we come down
after everything blows over.

343
00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:14.556
It's the last job, Carl.

344
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.741
Adios amigo.

345
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.790
Gracias.

346
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:17.827
Thank you for flying!

347
00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.085
Buenos dias.

348
00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:24.047
Chloe!

349
00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:43.442
Rome?

350
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.896
People don't really
pay attention

351
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.655
to the lines in the
street, do they?

352
00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.887
Nobody gives a crap about
anything in this town.

353
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:54.911
Look at this.

354
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.411
There's a lotta trees.

355
00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:01.454
You have snakes though,
they hide in these trees.

356
00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:02.913
Look at this guy!

357
00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.203
Look at that, look at you.

358
00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:06.923
No helmet.

359
00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:10.216
Safety first.

360
00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:12.423
You got poisonous snakes
or just regular snakes?

361
00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.390
Nothing, all right.

362
00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:17.758
I hate snakes.

363
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.767
Listen, I got two
words for you, okay?

364
00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:27.735
Air freshener.

365
00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:29.069
Use it.

366
00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:30.604
Smells like a
goddamn zoo in here.

367
00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:43.788
Welcome, Mr. Rome.

368
00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:45.168
My name is Laurie Williams.

369
00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.853
I'm the liaison in
charge of this location

370
00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.292
and whatever else
you might need.

371
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.832
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
great, wonderful.

372
00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:51.653
It is a real pleasure
to have you here, sir.

373
00:16:51.677 --> 00:16:53.339
I've heard quite
a bit about you.

374
00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:55.174
Listen, lady, cut
the horseshit, okay?

375
00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.805
Just show me where the goods are

376
00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.609
and introduce me to
Tweedledee and Tweedledum

377
00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.851
so I can get this last
nightmare over with.

378
00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:01.931
Oh, last?

379
00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:02.979
Did I stutter?

380
00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:05.814
All right then,
right this way.

381
00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:12.354
Yeah.

382
00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:14.318
I get greeted by a
goddamn waitress.

383
00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.249
Spare no expense, huh?

384
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:26.080
What's the layout like?

385
00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:28.745
The house has 10 bedrooms,
a game room, a sauna,

386
00:17:28.798 --> 00:17:31.381
pool, hot tub, and is
four stories in height.

387
00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:32.791
That's not the best place

388
00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:34.675
for one man to hold down
the fort, now is it?

389
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.927
About that...

390
00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.154
Glock here with three clips.

391
00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:55.198
Smooth action.

392
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.691
Well oiled.

393
00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.543
Well, one gun ain't
gonna make a difference.

394
00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:13.123
There's a 12-gauge sawed-off
shotgun in the closet

395
00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:15.918
for when matters need to be
dealt with at close range.

396
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.461
Anything within 10 feet

397
00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:18.532
you'll be washing red
out of your clothes

398
00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:19.556
for weeks to come.

399
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.931
Got rounds in there too?

400
00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.557
Plenty.

401
00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:23.954
There's a bat in the
closet near the front door

402
00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:25.469
as well as some golf clubs.

403
00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.729
There's also a toolbox
out by the pool shed

404
00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.435
with plenty of
screwdrivers and a hammer,

405
00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:32.567
but that's rather medieval,
if I do say so myself.

406
00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.353
Oh!

407
00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:36.943
So, I guess, when we're
talking about killing people,

408
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:39.404
there are different levels
of how brutal one can be

409
00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:42.195
while trying to
stay alive, right?

410
00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.078
Is that sarcasm, Mr. Rome?

411
00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:45.123
Never.

412
00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:46.916
Okay then!

413
00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.668
You got a lotta
stairs in this house.

414
00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.177
Oh, you'll get used to them.

415
00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.430
Yeah, I doubt it.

416
00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:03.966
This is the kitchen.

417
00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:14.442
Blade here, titanium,
will pierce most Kevlar.

418
00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.695
very fast and light weapon.

419
00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:20.281
Burner phone here in
case you need to contact

420
00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.942
anyone within the agency.

421
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.744
Car in the garage
for transportation.

422
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.075
You'll need that
for emergencies.

423
00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.455
You don't say.

424
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.957
Now, let's go back.

425
00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:35.129
I swear, I'm not
gonna miss this job.

426
00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:41.304
Holy...

427
00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:45.053
Do you like it?

428
00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:46.495
Mr. Reiser thought this
place would suit you well.

429
00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.556
Well, whatever
Mr. Reiser wants...

430
00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.855
Hey, it's pretty
open, don't you think?

431
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.186
What was that, Mr. Rome?

432
00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:57.444
Open, land, lotsa space!

433
00:19:57.488 --> 00:19:59.946
Lotsa different ways that
people could get in here.

434
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.652
I mean, look, for all we know,

435
00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:04.364
there could be snipers
out in these damn trees.

436
00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.449
No, we assure you we've
taken all precautions.

437
00:20:06.497 --> 00:20:07.933
Nobody knows that
the Bauers are here.

438
00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:08.975
Yeah, well, let's hope not.

439
00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:10.831
Wait, the Bauers?

440
00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:11.876
That's their name?

441
00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:12.955
Indeed it is.

442
00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.369
Would you like to meet them?

443
00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:16.004
- Yeah, that would be nice.
- Okay.

444
00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:17.048
Come on.

445
00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:21.426
Actually, where
are you hiding 'em?

446
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.836
You got 'em under lock and key

447
00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:24.629
in one of these
overlook tower rows?

448
00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:25.867
Because, you know, that's
where I would be hiding 'em.

449
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.177
No.

450
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.512
No, nothing so torturous.

451
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:29.955
They're out by the pool.
- Wait, what?

452
00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.345
Yeah, come on.

453
00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:32.763
No-no-no-no-no,
wait, wait, wait.

454
00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:33.917
You just let them
go for a damn swim

455
00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:34.815
out in the open by themselves?

456
00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:36.479
Yeah.

457
00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:37.963
Lady, do you know who
you're dealing with here?

458
00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:39.756
I assure you, we have
taken all precautions.

459
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.692
Nobody knows that they are here.

460
00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.700
These cats, the
Fratellis, right?

461
00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.360
They find them,

462
00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:47.931
they're gonna decorate
their next Christmas tree

463
00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:49.617
with their heads as
cute little ornaments.

464
00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.031
You get what I'm saying?

465
00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.995
I do, and that is
precisely why Mr. Reiser

466
00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.534
wanted you on this job.

467
00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.328
Now, would you like
to meet Mr. Ray Bauer

468
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.212
and Mrs. Camilla Bauer?

469
00:20:58.257 --> 00:20:59.089
Come on.

470
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.127
Sure!

471
00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.088
Let's meet the Bauers!

472
00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:04.846
Unbelievable!

473
00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:08.099
Is it gonna rain?!

474
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.100
It might.

475
00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:12.687
Oh, this is rich.

476
00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:23.526
Mickey Rome, I take it.

477
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:27.241
Thank you so much
for being here.

478
00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.659
You're not the sharpest
tool in the shed, are ya?

479
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.749
I beg your pardon?

480
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.831
Whose idea was it
to steal $8 million

481
00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:39.587
from one of the most ruthless
families in the world, huh?

482
00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:42.841
Tell me, whose
brilliant idea was that?

483
00:21:42.885 --> 00:21:43.717
Well...

484
00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:44.719
It was mine.

485
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.091
There you go, go figure.

486
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.636
Should we be talking
about this right now?

487
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:53.097
Oh, I'm not the one hiding
from contract killers,

488
00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.511
having a nice leisurely swim,

489
00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:56.429
giving the monkeys
a goddamn view!

490
00:21:56.482 --> 00:21:58.599
Yeah, I told my
husband to take the money

491
00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.517
because it was being
used for horrible things.

492
00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:02.856
Newsflash, all money is, lady.

493
00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:05.113
So, why let men
like that keep it

494
00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.114
when we could take it
and better our own lives?

495
00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.525
Because you'd be dead

496
00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:10.159
before you could
spend a penny of it.

497
00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:11.556
And besides, you're
turning state's evidence.

498
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.220
You gotta give all
that money back anyway.

499
00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:14.207
I don't think so.

500
00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:15.369
Oh yeah, how's that?

501
00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:16.908
Well, we've cut a deal.

502
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:19.374
I turn over their book
of accounts and contacts

503
00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:21.879
and we get to keep the money.

504
00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:27.131
Did God just
deal me a shit hand

505
00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.512
in the poker game of life?!

506
00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.970
Is that what's
happening right now?!

507
00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:33.849
Unbelievable!

508
00:22:33.894 --> 00:22:34.894
Rock!

509
00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:38.021
You said he was the best?

510
00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.476
He has the best
protection rate

511
00:22:39.525 --> 00:22:41.733
and our agency has
the best intel.

512
00:22:41.777 --> 00:22:44.986
Don't worry about Mr. Rome
and his abrasive personality.

513
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.842
He will make sure you two
live for the next few days

514
00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:48.949
until we can get you
transported back to stateside.

515
00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:51.827
And what if we
change our minds?

516
00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:53.578
You have a retainer
with us, Mr. Bauer.

517
00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:55.662
You have our protection
until that retainer runs out

518
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:56.994
or until you refill it.

519
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:59.896
I understand.

520
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.794
Bullshit!

521
00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:02.162
Goddamn bullshit.

522
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:06.048
Are you sure that
this place is secure?

523
00:23:06.093 --> 00:23:08.255
In your entire tenure for
working for us, Mr. Rome,

524
00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:10.170
it is the most secure
we have ever had,

525
00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:11.963
for it is off the grid.

526
00:23:12.016 --> 00:23:14.176
Otherwise, we would not call
it a safe house, would we?

527
00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:16.267
Shall we go inside?

528
00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:17.848
Show me
where the beer is.

529
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:25.402
Fuck!

530
00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:26.404
It's bullshit!

531
00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:30.357
I shall next be in contact

532
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:33.072
when we're ready to transfer
you over to the FBI.

533
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.452
Thank you.

534
00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:36.408
Yes, we're very grateful.

535
00:23:36.457 --> 00:23:37.743
No need for thanks.

536
00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:38.872
You paid us well.

537
00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:40.409
This is what our agency does.

538
00:23:40.461 --> 00:23:41.702
Bye for now.

539
00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.371
Fuck this fucking fuck!

540
00:23:49.219 --> 00:23:51.211
What?!

541
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.143
What?!

542
00:23:58.145 --> 00:23:59.181
What do you want?!

543
00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.470
What the fuck are you look...

544
00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:15.906
What does the dynamic duo want?

545
00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:21.078
Well, I'd say a
conversation, Mr. Rome.

546
00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:24.585
Look, the next time
someone calls me Mr. Rome,

547
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.732
I'm gonna go into that closet,

548
00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:27.418
I'm gonna grab a baseball bat,

549
00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.235
come back, smash somebody
across the face with it.

550
00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:31.421
Just do me a favor.

551
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.470
Call me Mickey.

552
00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:35.421
All right, all right.

553
00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:39.218
So, where do we go
from here, Mickey?

554
00:24:42.856 --> 00:24:45.098
All right, look,
nobody leaves this house,

555
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.516
nobody leaves my sight.

556
00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:48.296
If you see something
suspicious, you tell me.

557
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.357
If the neighbor's
dog takes a shit

558
00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:52.819
and it doesn't look right,
I wanna know about it.

559
00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:54.678
You have a real way with
talking to people, don't you?

560
00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:55.988
Is she always like this?

561
00:24:56.036 --> 00:24:57.368
You know what,
you got a real way

562
00:24:57.413 --> 00:24:58.473
of getting yourself
into trouble!

563
00:24:58.497 --> 00:24:59.738
Is this what we should expect

564
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.201
for the next few days?
- What?

565
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.832
That you're gonna
make us feel like

566
00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:03.710
we constantly have to
apologize for taking the money?

567
00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:04.711
Stealing!

568
00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:06.745
Lady, you stole the money!

569
00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:10.131
Well, well, quite frankly,
they stole it before we did.

570
00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.586
How do you know that?

571
00:25:11.635 --> 00:25:13.797
I saw all the deals
that were accounted for.

572
00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:15.633
Heroin shipments,
cocaine pickups;

573
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:19.345
anything that had a dollar
value, I had to account for it.

574
00:25:19.393 --> 00:25:22.727
Yeah, we need to get
something straight, Mickey.

575
00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:26.139
We paid a huge chunk of
cash to have you here,

576
00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:29.059
and I'm a bit shocked
they didn't send more.

577
00:25:30.404 --> 00:25:31.770
What is that supposed to mean?

578
00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:33.258
I think we thought
that they'd send

579
00:25:33.282 --> 00:25:37.868
somebody a bit
younger is all, right?

580
00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:39.243
Yup.

581
00:25:39.288 --> 00:25:42.406
Bottom line is
you're our employee.

582
00:25:42.458 --> 00:25:46.418
So, if we wanna go on a
walk on the beach, we will.

583
00:25:46.462 --> 00:25:49.876
If we wanna go lounge
in the sun, we will.

584
00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:51.539
If we wanna go into town,

585
00:25:51.592 --> 00:25:54.209
you are gonna be by our
side with your eyes open

586
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:56.127
and your ears
constantly listening.

587
00:25:57.181 --> 00:25:58.513
Do we understand each other?

588
00:26:00.434 --> 00:26:03.677
I understand that
I need to make a phone call.

589
00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:07.437
It's, it's okay.

590
00:26:07.483 --> 00:26:09.395
He's been drinking.

591
00:26:09.443 --> 00:26:10.443
He's a little angry.

592
00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:19.784
Reiser speaking.

593
00:26:19.828 --> 00:26:20.746
Get me outta here, Carl.

594
00:26:20.747 --> 00:26:21.827
This is bullshit!

595
00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:22.988
Mickey, calm down.

596
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.497
No, no, no.

597
00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:26.282
You got me protecting
two entitled kids

598
00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:28.748
who have no idea the trouble
they got themselves into.

599
00:26:28.796 --> 00:26:30.162
Just sit on 'em.

600
00:26:30.214 --> 00:26:32.376
Just relax, sit on
'em for 72 hours.

601
00:26:32.424 --> 00:26:34.711
I know you at least can do that.

602
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.321
You got me trying
to protect Fort Knox,

603
00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:37.961
for Christ sakes.

604
00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:39.449
This place is bigger than
the Bermuda Triangle!

605
00:26:39.473 --> 00:26:41.214
You're mixing your
metaphors again.

606
00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:44.600
Mickey, is it Fort Knox or
is it the Bermuda Triangle?

607
00:26:44.645 --> 00:26:45.761
Regardless...

608
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:49.271
I'm a little hurt

609
00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:51.116
'cause honestly I thought
you would like that.

610
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.022
Oh, it's nice, sure.

611
00:26:54.071 --> 00:26:55.812
But I have a hard
time doing my job

612
00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:59.232
knowing that the goddamn
toucans can get in this place.

613
00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:02.652
I'd completely side with
you if it were a problem,

614
00:27:02.704 --> 00:27:05.037
but it's not a problem, you see?

615
00:27:05.082 --> 00:27:06.698
There is nothing to worry about.

616
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.036
I hear you.

617
00:27:08.085 --> 00:27:09.667
If there were something
to worry about,

618
00:27:09.711 --> 00:27:11.147
I would completely
understand, but there's not.

619
00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:13.379
There's nothing to worry about.

620
00:27:13.423 --> 00:27:14.818
Everybody
keeps saying that.

621
00:27:14.842 --> 00:27:16.799
Do you know something
that I don't?

622
00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:19.552
The feds are occupying
the Fratellis, okay?

623
00:27:19.596 --> 00:27:22.304
There's taps on all of
their colleagues' phones.

624
00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:25.262
If the wind so much as
blows in this direction,

625
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.302
we'll know it, if
you catch my drift.

626
00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:28.640
Yeah.

627
00:27:30.274 --> 00:27:32.766
Just kick back, would ya?

628
00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:35.026
Let the married
couple do their thing.

629
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.732
You go through the paces

630
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.238
and try to relax and
enjoy the sunshine.

631
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:40.649
Fuck the sunshine.

632
00:27:40.701 --> 00:27:42.061
I'll call you
tomorrow to check in.

633
00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:45.740
"Fuck the sunshine."

634
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:51.097
Do you mind some company?

635
00:28:58.862 --> 00:29:00.632
Look, I don't have anything
left in the tank, okay?

636
00:29:00.656 --> 00:29:01.988
So just be easy on me.

637
00:29:04.785 --> 00:29:06.071
Is that such a good idea?

638
00:29:08.705 --> 00:29:10.037
I'll have you
know I aim better

639
00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:11.539
when I'm under the influence.

640
00:29:15.212 --> 00:29:16.212
I'm sorry.

641
00:29:20.634 --> 00:29:22.045
For what?

642
00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:23.175
I was rude earlier.

643
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.922
I do understand we're
in a bad situation.

644
00:29:32.312 --> 00:29:34.474
My mother was in
really bad shape.

645
00:29:36.525 --> 00:29:38.061
She needed a heart transplant.

646
00:29:39.403 --> 00:29:42.396
They'd only given her
a few months to live.

647
00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:47.734
We'd asked the doctors how we
could get her name moved up.

648
00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:52.538
A few of them knew that my
husband worked for the Fratellis,

649
00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:57.578
so they said that if we came
back with a high enough number,

650
00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:59.416
they'd bump her to
the top of the list.

651
00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.374
So, he started embezzling funds,

652
00:30:05.178 --> 00:30:06.840
just a few dollars
here and there,

653
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:09.297
from hundreds of accounts.

654
00:30:11.601 --> 00:30:14.765
And he would cook the books
so they'd never find out.

655
00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.931
There were millions coming in.

656
00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:22.317
For three months we did this

657
00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:25.901
and I would just try to figure
out where to hide the cash.

658
00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:27.030
The flowerbed.

659
00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:29.443
My locker at the gym.

660
00:30:32.164 --> 00:30:36.078
Eventually, we knew that they'd
find out, so we prepared.

661
00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:38.836
And now, here we are.

662
00:30:42.299 --> 00:30:43.299
And my mother...

663
00:30:45.427 --> 00:30:46.427
She lived.

664
00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:52.431
So, it was worth it, Mickey.

665
00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:58.809
You may only have postponed
your mother's death.

666
00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:01.311
No, she's safe.

667
00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:03.527
Safer than us.

668
00:31:04.488 --> 00:31:05.820
Agency protecting her too?

669
00:31:07.282 --> 00:31:08.282
No.

670
00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:15.158
Hospital really
stuck it to ya, huh?

671
00:31:17.084 --> 00:31:19.792
No, everyone just looks out
for themselves in this world.

672
00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:24.832
They find something to leverage
and they play their cards.

673
00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:25.883
Some win.

674
00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:27.676
Some lose.

675
00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:30.304
Yeah.

676
00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:33.263
I've always hated hospitals.

677
00:31:45.028 --> 00:31:46.028
Mr. Rome?

678
00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:50.531
Do you have many friends?

679
00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:56.078
I don't mean the
question in a mean way.

680
00:31:56.123 --> 00:31:57.534
I mean to ask because

681
00:31:59.709 --> 00:32:01.371
your job must make you lonely.

682
00:32:04.506 --> 00:32:09.467
You know, protecting other
people for hours, days, nights;

683
00:32:12.222 --> 00:32:17.138
like tonight must take you
away from people you love.

684
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:20.771
So...

685
00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:22.565
I was thinking

686
00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:27.481
maybe you weren't close
to too many people.

687
00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:38.910
I understand someone like
me might just be a job

688
00:32:41.084 --> 00:32:43.701
and that you probably
have had to protect

689
00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:45.460
a lot of defenseless people

690
00:32:45.505 --> 00:32:48.669
with rich parents or
husbands or whatever.

691
00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:54.054
But...

692
00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:59.593
I just wanna say thank
you for being here.

693
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.006
Hey, boss, ain't
it a bit late?

694
00:34:21.685 --> 00:34:22.721
Oh!

695
00:34:22.769 --> 00:34:24.049
People are trying to sleep here!

696
00:34:51.047 --> 00:34:54.290
Mickey!

697
00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:57.676
You still using that
pussy.38 Special?

698
00:34:57.721 --> 00:34:59.428
When you gonna get
a big boy's gun?

699
00:34:59.472 --> 00:35:01.088
Francisco, you asshole!

700
00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:45.017
Yeah.

701
00:35:45.018 --> 00:35:46.475
Get your ass up.

702
00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:47.353
Come on.

703
00:35:47.354 --> 00:35:48.640
Come on, get up!

704
00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:57.988
Girl's gotta go.

705
00:36:25.392 --> 00:36:26.392
Who was she?

706
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.852
She was a client,
just like you.

707
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.400
Did she live?

708
00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:40.946
Yeah, she did.

709
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.990
Hey.

710
00:36:43.785 --> 00:36:45.401
What'd I miss?

711
00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:50.660
Your wife was explaining to
me why y'all stole the money.

712
00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:55.337
Oh.

713
00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:02.418
Look, I'll try not
to be an asshole, okay?

714
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.927
But I make no promises.

715
00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:10.009
How did you become
their accountant anyway?

716
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.146
My father.

717
00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:15.686
He, he worked for them.

718
00:37:15.734 --> 00:37:17.066
In what capacity?

719
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.110
Same thing.

720
00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:21.904
I was raised being told this
was the family business.

721
00:37:24.576 --> 00:37:26.317
Some Sopranos-type bullshit.

722
00:37:29.748 --> 00:37:31.364
$8 million.

723
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.840
What?

724
00:37:41.634 --> 00:37:43.751
It wasn't actually $8 million.

725
00:37:46.556 --> 00:37:47.888
It was $23 million.

726
00:37:49.392 --> 00:37:50.633
What?

727
00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:52.301
Do the feds know this?

728
00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:54.015
No.

729
00:37:54.063 --> 00:37:57.056
The only actual traceable
money is the $8 million.

730
00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:58.440
Traceable?

731
00:37:58.485 --> 00:38:01.148
As in, what the
Fratellis might notice.

732
00:38:01.196 --> 00:38:04.155
How does $15
million go unnoticed?

733
00:38:06.075 --> 00:38:07.111
I found an account.

734
00:38:08.787 --> 00:38:10.449
It wasn't listed on
any of the ledgers,

735
00:38:10.497 --> 00:38:13.240
it was just there.

736
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:19.079
So, I took a look at
deposit schedules,

737
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.962
past withdrawals, everything.

738
00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:24.049
No one associated
with the family

739
00:38:24.093 --> 00:38:26.085
had anything to do
with that account.

740
00:38:28.097 --> 00:38:30.931
So, at first, I siphoned
off a few hundred thousand,

741
00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:32.932
just to see if there
were any red flags.

742
00:38:34.479 --> 00:38:35.479
Nothing.

743
00:38:36.898 --> 00:38:37.898
Then a million.

744
00:38:39.234 --> 00:38:40.234
Not a peep.

745
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:45.188
So, one day I just brought it up

746
00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.948
in water cooler
talk-type fashion.

747
00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:50.279
No one knew anything
about that account.

748
00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:54.576
So, when Camilla and
I set up our plan,

749
00:38:54.624 --> 00:38:55.660
it was the motherlode.

750
00:38:57.669 --> 00:38:59.376
That was our nest egg.

751
00:39:02.924 --> 00:39:05.291
If they weren't gonna let
us keep our $8 million,

752
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.798
at least we had the
rest to fall back on.

753
00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:14.429
Well, I guess,
like someone said,

754
00:39:14.477 --> 00:39:16.639
when you have leverage,
you play those cards.

755
00:39:22.068 --> 00:39:23.309
You two should go to bed.

756
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:26.403
I gotta spend the
rest of the night

757
00:39:26.447 --> 00:39:28.287
watching toucans and
monkeys fuck in the trees.

758
00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.619
- Come on.
- Good night, Mickey.

759
00:39:34.664 --> 00:39:35.664
Yeah.

760
00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:38.625
Thank you.

761
00:39:46.676 --> 00:39:47.837
Yeah, don't mention it.

762
00:39:53.182 --> 00:39:54.764
Do you have many friends?

763
00:39:57.896 --> 00:40:00.559
I don't mean the
question in a mean way.

764
00:40:02.317 --> 00:40:06.982
I mean to ask because
your work must be lonely.

765
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.697
You aren't close to many people.

766
00:40:25.256 --> 00:40:26.256
Morning.

767
00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:31.169
What time is it?

768
00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.220
It's 8:00.

769
00:40:33.514 --> 00:40:35.005
Ray and I wanna go
to the beach today.

770
00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:37.684
Wonderful.

771
00:40:37.727 --> 00:40:39.764
That's a safe place to go.

772
00:40:39.812 --> 00:40:40.812
Are you coming?

773
00:40:44.067 --> 00:40:45.067
Fine.

774
00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:47.235
Thank you.

775
00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:48.352
Let's go to the beach.

776
00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:57.987
Hot, hot, hot.

777
00:40:58.039 --> 00:40:59.039
I'm up.

778
00:40:59.999 --> 00:41:00.999
That's hot.

779
00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:13.422
It's like you two are on
vacation, it's insane.

780
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.140
Yeah, not quite.

781
00:41:20.937 --> 00:41:22.428
I heard you were
the scared one.

782
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.480
Scared?

783
00:41:24.273 --> 00:41:25.273
Yeah.

784
00:41:27.944 --> 00:41:28.944
But not for me.

785
00:41:30.238 --> 00:41:31.238
For Camilla.

786
00:41:33.282 --> 00:41:35.148
See, I don't care
what happens to me.

787
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:39.890
But I couldn't live with myself

788
00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:41.121
if anything happened to her.

789
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.617
Well, to love.

790
00:41:44.669 --> 00:41:45.785
It can be a bitch.

791
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:52.921
So, were you ever
married, Mickey?

792
00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:53.969
Once.

793
00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:58.714
What?

794
00:41:58.766 --> 00:42:01.224
Do you want me to
elaborate on that?

795
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.187
Yeah, why not?

796
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.270
We're not friends, okay?

797
00:42:05.314 --> 00:42:06.805
This is a job.

798
00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:09.271
Why don't you people
understand that?

799
00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:13.194
Look, women want
one thing one day,

800
00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:15.481
and then another day
they want something else.

801
00:42:16.617 --> 00:42:17.617
And?

802
00:42:18.828 --> 00:42:21.161
And I had a wife, okay?

803
00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:24.073
And she wanted to have
kids, so we had one.

804
00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:26.287
Wasn't in this profession
then, I was a cop.

805
00:42:26.335 --> 00:42:27.997
I was working all
sorts of crazy hours,

806
00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:30.413
was never really home much.

807
00:42:30.465 --> 00:42:32.673
I'm sure that had to be tough.

808
00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:33.833
That was hard enough.

809
00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:37.144
So, I take it you two
aren't still together.

810
00:42:39.265 --> 00:42:40.881
So, then what happened?

811
00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:42.773
You're a persistent
little prick, aren't you?

812
00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.847
Yeah, my wife's been
known to say the same thing.

813
00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:45.896
Yeah.

814
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:48.690
Well, like I said,

815
00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:51.943
long hours.

816
00:42:57.158 --> 00:42:59.616
You know, for five years
all she had was that kid.

817
00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:02.615
She had to take care
of it all by herself.

818
00:43:05.917 --> 00:43:07.328
I'd come home late
in the mornings

819
00:43:07.376 --> 00:43:09.914
and I would stare
at her in her crib.

820
00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:14.415
In a blink of an eye, she's
sleeping in a little bed.

821
00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:19.336
I'd try to get home
early from work

822
00:43:19.388 --> 00:43:23.598
just to rock her to sleep,
but being a cop, it's rare.

823
00:43:23.643 --> 00:43:24.643
But my wife...

824
00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:31.269
She couldn't handle it, so
she took to the pills first,

825
00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.105
then the booze.

826
00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:36.941
I came home one night after
busting this big case.

827
00:43:36.989 --> 00:43:39.231
Wine, flowers, the
whole nine yards, right?

828
00:43:41.369 --> 00:43:43.736
Found her dead on
the floor, overdose.

829
00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:46.242
I go to look for my kid.

830
00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:01.215
She's dead in the tub.

831
00:44:07.061 --> 00:44:09.098
Wife drowned her
during bath time.

832
00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:12.226
She used to have
this yellow ducky

833
00:44:12.275 --> 00:44:13.561
that she fuckin' loved so much

834
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:15.191
and it was just floating there

835
00:44:15.236 --> 00:44:17.398
with a goddamn smile
stretched across its face.

836
00:44:19.824 --> 00:44:20.824
Mickey...

837
00:44:24.203 --> 00:44:25.284
I'm so sorry, man.

838
00:44:26.205 --> 00:44:27.946
Don't be.

839
00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:29.351
Life throws you curveballs
and can be a son of a bitch.

840
00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:30.991
All you can do is
try and hit 'em.

841
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:34.832
That's it for story time.

842
00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:49.431
Are we safe, Ray?

843
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:55.683
Yeah, I think so.

844
00:44:57.445 --> 00:44:58.981
Do you trust him?

845
00:45:00.114 --> 00:45:01.230
Who, Mickey?

846
00:45:07.288 --> 00:45:08.529
Yeah.

847
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:09.617
I think I do.

848
00:45:11.876 --> 00:45:14.835
I don't know who
to trust anymore.

849
00:45:16.464 --> 00:45:17.464
Hey.

850
00:45:18.925 --> 00:45:21.918
Why are you feeling this way?

851
00:45:21.969 --> 00:45:23.363
Just, the more that
Mickey keeps going on

852
00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:25.003
about these people,

853
00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:26.909
the more I feel like maybe
this is just too easy.

854
00:45:26.933 --> 00:45:30.267
And that's why we paid what
we did, for this protection.

855
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.766
For his protection.

856
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.357
I don't have a good
feeling about any of this.

857
00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:42.941
Listen to me.

858
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.358
Everything is gonna
be okay, I promise.

859
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.151
We will turn in state's evidence

860
00:45:48.204 --> 00:45:50.537
and we will make sure that
the Fratellis are put away.

861
00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:53.039
And then, we will disappear.

862
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:55.701
You make it sound so simple.

863
00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:01.965
I actually think it's gonna be
a lot harder than we thought.

864
00:46:02.009 --> 00:46:04.717
Then we will face it.

865
00:46:04.762 --> 00:46:05.762
Together.

866
00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:12.936
Get a room!

867
00:46:14.689 --> 00:46:17.181
Jesus!

868
00:46:17.233 --> 00:46:18.519
Is it so wrong
to hate the fact

869
00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:19.899
that he's starting
to grow on me?

870
00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:20.944
Me too.

871
00:46:23.906 --> 00:46:25.363
He's got a lotta baggage, Cam.

872
00:46:25.408 --> 00:46:26.774
Yeah, what gave it away?

873
00:46:26.826 --> 00:46:27.907
No, I'm serious.

874
00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:30.364
I spent a little time with him.

875
00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.409
You know, he comes
off as incapable,

876
00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:38.122
but I think he's way more
capable than we know.

877
00:46:39.922 --> 00:46:41.163
I won't doubt that then.

878
00:46:51.142 --> 00:46:52.633
Hey!

879
00:46:52.685 --> 00:46:53.926
Stay here, don't move.

880
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.566
What are you doing here, Paulie?

881
00:47:09.618 --> 00:47:11.054
'Cause any other
reason than the best

882
00:47:11.078 --> 00:47:12.556
is gonna make me
pretty fucking uneasy.

883
00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:14.788
Yeah, well, the call
you made to Reiser

884
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:15.892
made him a little bithesitant

885
00:47:15.916 --> 00:47:17.144
that you can handle this thing.

886
00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:18.168
Hesitant?

887
00:47:19.712 --> 00:47:21.148
I never quit a job in my
life, even you know that.

888
00:47:21.172 --> 00:47:22.959
Ah, yeah, well...

889
00:47:23.007 --> 00:47:24.464
We all slip up
sometimes, don't we?

890
00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:25.999
Nah.

891
00:47:26.052 --> 00:47:27.759
You see, Mickey Rome,
he doesn't slip up.

892
00:47:29.722 --> 00:47:31.133
How the lovebirds doing?

893
00:47:31.182 --> 00:47:32.218
Fine.

894
00:47:32.266 --> 00:47:33.368
And what about you, you okay?

895
00:47:33.392 --> 00:47:34.724
What's with the small talk?

896
00:47:34.769 --> 00:47:36.305
Just trying to
be friendly, Mick.

897
00:47:40.358 --> 00:47:42.315
You ain't got a friendly
bone in your body.

898
00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:46.131
Well, since we're gonna
be working together now,

899
00:47:46.155 --> 00:47:47.896
I figured I'd try
to keep it cordial.

900
00:47:49.033 --> 00:47:50.365
Working together?

901
00:47:50.409 --> 00:47:51.369
Nobody told me
anything about that.

902
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:52.826
No?

903
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.157
Well, maybe you should
call Deacon and Reiser.

904
00:47:56.374 --> 00:48:00.243
I'll tell ya what, let
me call 'em for ya.

905
00:48:06.675 --> 00:48:07.836
Yeah, it's me.

906
00:48:09.595 --> 00:48:10.881
Uh-huh.

907
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.341
Yeah, he's right in front of me.

908
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.390
Absolutely.

909
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:16.893
Yeah.

910
00:48:22.066 --> 00:48:25.275
Mickey, I see Paulie found ya.

911
00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:28.027
Yeah, he's staring at me
like a hawk stares at a rabbit.

912
00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:29.608
Cute.

913
00:48:29.657 --> 00:48:31.239
Is there anything
I should know about?

914
00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:37.154
Nothing to worry about.

915
00:48:37.206 --> 00:48:38.697
Carl just thought you might need

916
00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:40.490
a little extra set of
hands just in case.

917
00:48:40.543 --> 00:48:42.910
Paulie's gonna be around
just if it gets to that point

918
00:48:42.962 --> 00:48:44.453
where you can't
take it, that's all.

919
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:45.996
Well, if it's okay with you,

920
00:48:46.048 --> 00:48:47.109
I'd like him not to
stay at the McMansion.

921
00:48:47.133 --> 00:48:48.499
He gives me the heebie-jeebies.

922
00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:52.711
You got anything
worthwhile to contribute yet?

923
00:48:54.098 --> 00:48:55.098
Fuck you.

924
00:49:00.729 --> 00:49:02.391
Paulie's gonna be around.

925
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.729
Listen, Mickey, I know
you don't like him,

926
00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:08.439
but he's effective
and he's efficient.

927
00:49:08.487 --> 00:49:10.424
You used to say that
about me a time or two ago.

928
00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:11.780
Just play nice, Mickey.

929
00:49:11.824 --> 00:49:13.360
I'll see you when you get back.

930
00:49:15.244 --> 00:49:16.244
Yeah.

931
00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:21.290
Everything go good?

932
00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:22.124
Peachy.

933
00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:23.126
Fantastic.

934
00:49:24.712 --> 00:49:26.712
Now, if anything should
happen, call me right away.

935
00:49:28.257 --> 00:49:31.250
I know Laurie programmed
my number into your phone.

936
00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:32.302
Hey, Mick.

937
00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:35.299
Careful out there.

938
00:49:35.347 --> 00:49:38.761
You never know who
you're gonna run into.

939
00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:56.942
Hey.

940
00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:57.910
Who was that, Mickey?

941
00:49:57.912 --> 00:49:59.244
They sent another one.

942
00:49:59.288 --> 00:50:00.515
- Another...
- Specialist, like me.

943
00:50:00.539 --> 00:50:02.201
Why would they do that?

944
00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:02.957
Because they don't think
I got it in me no more,

945
00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:03.958
all right?

946
00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:04.709
Grab your shit, let's go.

947
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:06.122
Let's go!

948
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:07.610
- Let's go, come on, come on.
- Okay.

949
00:50:08.756 --> 00:50:09.756
Let's go.

950
00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:12.799
Let's go, come on.

951
00:50:38.827 --> 00:50:39.908
Good afternoon, Mickey.

952
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:42.821
What's so good about it?

953
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:48.209
Well, we're still
alive, right?

954
00:50:48.254 --> 00:50:49.254
For now.

955
00:50:52.925 --> 00:50:54.336
I'm sorry.

956
00:50:54.385 --> 00:50:55.421
Bad joke, I guess.

957
00:50:58.222 --> 00:50:59.429
Yeah, what do you want?

958
00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:04.763
Can you take a walk?

959
00:51:11.402 --> 00:51:12.518
Yeah, sure.

960
00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:13.902
I gotta do my rounds anyway.

961
00:51:27.042 --> 00:51:28.158
So, I have a question.

962
00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:29.326
You have a million.

963
00:51:34.091 --> 00:51:36.003
Did you always
run protection gigs?

964
00:51:38.596 --> 00:51:39.596
No.

965
00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:40.597
Why?

966
00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:46.176
I know your company
does other things as well.

967
00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:50.268
Yeah, it's a
business, all of it.

968
00:51:52.318 --> 00:51:53.318
So...

969
00:51:55.279 --> 00:51:56.279
Did you do...

970
00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:01.403
Did you do other
things with them

971
00:52:02.745 --> 00:52:05.988
or other things
entirely different?

972
00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:09.582
Where are you going with this?

973
00:52:09.627 --> 00:52:11.994
I just wanna know how
your business works.

974
00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:13.004
Why?

975
00:52:13.005 --> 00:52:14.587
Why do you even care?

976
00:52:14.632 --> 00:52:16.109
Why did they send
another protection agent?

977
00:52:16.133 --> 00:52:17.485
Because I'm getting
fuckin' old, okay?

978
00:52:17.509 --> 00:52:18.509
That's why.

979
00:52:20.137 --> 00:52:21.423
Is that what you wanna hear.

980
00:52:22.765 --> 00:52:24.506
Old for this
type of occupation?

981
00:52:27.061 --> 00:52:28.518
Yeah.

982
00:52:28.562 --> 00:52:30.162
I mean, most guys,
they retire around 40.

983
00:52:32.274 --> 00:52:33.274
Just...

984
00:52:34.652 --> 00:52:36.046
Too many blows to the
head, too many scars.

985
00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:37.777
We're just, we're
human, all right?

986
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.733
That's why they sent the
asshole as an insurance policy.

987
00:52:46.121 --> 00:52:47.737
- Insurance policy.
- Yeah.

988
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:50.077
Something goes wrong, they
got somebody close by.

989
00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:53.417
Well, that doesn't make sense.

990
00:52:55.047 --> 00:52:57.881
One minute it does, the
next minute it doesn't.

991
00:53:02.763 --> 00:53:03.763
Yeah, but...

992
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:08.308
Why Paulie, you know?

993
00:53:11.438 --> 00:53:13.395
That's what I don't understand.

994
00:53:15.984 --> 00:53:17.065
Yeah, about that guy,

995
00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:20.006
you know, the one we
saw at the beach today?

996
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.030
What's wrong with him?

997
00:53:23.367 --> 00:53:24.903
He doesn't work in protection.

998
00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:27.076
Well then, what's he do?

999
00:53:29.289 --> 00:53:31.281
He works in collections.

1000
00:53:33.127 --> 00:53:35.119
Remember I told you
that I did something

1001
00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:38.163
before I worked in the
protection department?

1002
00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:39.215
Yeah.

1003
00:53:40.384 --> 00:53:41.670
I worked in collections.

1004
00:53:44.096 --> 00:53:45.462
Are you calling
'cause you miss me

1005
00:53:45.514 --> 00:53:46.874
or are you giving
me the thumbs-up?

1006
00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:48.891
Yes to which part?

1007
00:53:51.812 --> 00:53:53.144
What if he doesn't have it?

1008
00:53:54.982 --> 00:53:57.599
Look, Carl, I'm not in the
business of killing people.

1009
00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:03.692
Yeah.

1010
00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:04.741
Got it.

1011
00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:14.083
Excuse me, miss.

1012
00:54:15.669 --> 00:54:17.706
Can I get a bottle of your
best champagne, please?

1013
00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:19.792
Best champagne?

1014
00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.706
You having a spendy
afternoon, are you?

1015
00:54:23.302 --> 00:54:26.295
Which one of the girls you
showing a good time to?

1016
00:54:26.346 --> 00:54:28.429
Oh, it's not for
any of the girls.

1017
00:54:28.474 --> 00:54:29.885
It's my friend over there.

1018
00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:32.050
Oh, you're friends with Matty?

1019
00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:33.102
Best friends.

1020
00:54:34.396 --> 00:54:36.058
Bottle of Dom
coming right up then.

1021
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:45.115
There you go.

1022
00:54:45.116 --> 00:54:46.032
Ah, thank you.

1023
00:54:46.033 --> 00:54:47.114
No need for glasses.

1024
00:54:47.159 --> 00:54:48.741
Not gonna need it.

1025
00:54:48.786 --> 00:54:49.822
Oh, and do me a favor.

1026
00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:51.990
Put it on Matty's tab.

1027
00:54:56.919 --> 00:54:57.919
Matty!

1028
00:54:58.879 --> 00:54:59.879
My man!

1029
00:54:59.922 --> 00:55:00.922
How ya doin'?

1030
00:55:02.466 --> 00:55:03.502
Do I know you, man?

1031
00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:05.667
Nope, you actually do not.

1032
00:55:07.179 --> 00:55:08.990
Okay, well, then why the
fuck are you interrupting

1033
00:55:09.014 --> 00:55:11.848
a conversation between
me and my man here?

1034
00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:12.892
Bruiser.

1035
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.806
Long time no see.

1036
00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:16.854
Mickey Rome.

1037
00:55:18.524 --> 00:55:20.043
Thought I smelled shit when
I walked in here today.

1038
00:55:22.444 --> 00:55:24.088
That's because you're the
one who usually steps in it.

1039
00:55:24.112 --> 00:55:26.604
How's unemployment
treating you these days?

1040
00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:28.148
Do I look unemployed to you?

1041
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.567
Hmm, let's take a look atcha.

1042
00:55:30.619 --> 00:55:32.406
Eh, maybe not,

1043
00:55:32.454 --> 00:55:35.288
but this guy looks like he
shops at the bargain bin, huh?

1044
00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:38.291
What were the deals last
week, three suits for $99.99?

1045
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:44.922
Always with the
comedy, huh, Mickey?

1046
00:55:44.967 --> 00:55:46.333
Get the fuck outta here.

1047
00:55:46.385 --> 00:55:48.251
I'm afraid I can't do that.

1048
00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:50.260
You see, I'm here for a reason,

1049
00:55:50.305 --> 00:55:52.262
and that reason you're
really not gonna like

1050
00:55:52.307 --> 00:55:54.799
and that Bruiser here
can probably guess.

1051
00:55:54.852 --> 00:55:56.639
Mickey, I ain't
gonna ask you twice.

1052
00:55:56.687 --> 00:55:58.974
You think I give a
fuck about that reason?

1053
00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:00.638
I feel like you should.

1054
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:02.023
My name is Mickey.

1055
00:56:02.067 --> 00:56:03.127
I'm here on behalf
of Carl Reiser.

1056
00:56:03.151 --> 00:56:04.254
You know who I'm talking about?

1057
00:56:04.278 --> 00:56:05.438
Take a hike, Mickey.

1058
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.486
Yeah, I know who he is.

1059
00:56:08.532 --> 00:56:09.693
So, what's this about?

1060
00:56:09.741 --> 00:56:10.948
All right, good.

1061
00:56:10.993 --> 00:56:12.529
See, progress.

1062
00:56:12.578 --> 00:56:14.069
You borrowed money a while ago

1063
00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:16.989
to open up this
miraculous establishment.

1064
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.952
It's seedy as fuck!

1065
00:56:19.001 --> 00:56:21.414
Anyway, you never paid it back.

1066
00:56:21.461 --> 00:56:25.250
So, today, I'm here to
collect the bill in full.

1067
00:56:25.299 --> 00:56:26.299
In full?

1068
00:56:31.889 --> 00:56:35.303
I knew I recognized this
guy, he's a fucking comedian!

1069
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.057
I'm gonna get that
money.

1070
00:56:37.102 --> 00:56:39.094
You're sure gonna get it.

1071
00:56:39.146 --> 00:56:40.415
Bruiser, will you do me a favor?

1072
00:56:40.439 --> 00:56:41.930
Yes sir.

1073
00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:43.723
Would you make
it so princess here

1074
00:56:43.775 --> 00:56:45.295
sips out of a straw for the
rest of his fucking life?

1075
00:56:45.319 --> 00:56:47.060
- It'd be my pleasure.
- That's a bad idea.

1076
00:57:04.338 --> 00:57:06.000
I fucking hate my job!

1077
00:57:06.048 --> 00:57:07.880
Wanna switch?

1078
00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:36.784
I hate that suit!

1079
00:57:39.247 --> 00:57:40.954
So, I went from being a cop

1080
00:57:40.999 --> 00:57:42.727
to collecting money to
beating the shit outta people

1081
00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:45.334
to protecting people who
couldn't protect themselves.

1082
00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:47.795
Weird world we live in, man.

1083
00:57:48.757 --> 00:57:51.215
Like I said, curveballs.

1084
00:59:54.257 --> 00:59:56.214
"Most secure place
we ever had," my ass.

1085
01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:18.405
Shit!

1086
01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.308
Hello, Mr. Rome, I just
wanted to see how things are

1087
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:28.664
and if everything's okay.

1088
01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.074
No, Laurie,
things are not okay!

1089
01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.584
We need to leave right now!

1090
01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.119
Where are the Bauers?

1091
01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:34.607
I have 'em upstairs
under lock and key.

1092
01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:35.631
Fantastic.

1093
01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:03.404
Oh my god.

1094
01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.738
Oh shit.

1095
01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:08.820
What we do, Mickey?

1096
01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:09.984
Tell us what we need to do!

1097
01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:13.414
Paulie.

1098
01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.947
Paulie; call Paulie.

1099
01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:16.917
Okay, stay with him.

1100
01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:17.918
Stay right there.

1101
01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:18.997
I'll be right back, okay?

1102
01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:21.505
I'll be right back.

1103
01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:24.255
I'm sorry, Mickey.

1104
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:30.881
I'm so sorry.

1105
01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:37.186
Jesus Christ.

1106
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.597
Paulie, Paulie, Paulie.

1107
01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:40.649
Okay.

1108
01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:44.151
Mickey.

1109
01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:47.438
No, this isn't
Mickey, it's Ray Bauer.

1110
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.698
Oh, hello, Mr. Bauer,
how can I help you today?

1111
01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.905
A woman, she came to kill us.

1112
01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:53.034
We've met her before.

1113
01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.036
Mickey, he's hurt real bad!

1114
01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:57.248
How bad?

1115
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.250
Very.

1116
01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.480
All right, just lock
all the doors and stay put.

1117
01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:02.961
I'll be there shortly.

1118
01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.066
In the meantime, try to
get Mickey comfortable.

1119
01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:05.501
All right.

1120
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:07.337
What happened
to the liaison?

1121
01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:08.385
Liaison?

1122
01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.178
Mickey, he killed her.

1123
01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:12.463
She's, she's dead.

1124
01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:16.370
All right,
I'll be right there.

1125
01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:17.394
Okay.

1126
01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:26.987
Fuck.

1127
01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:37.872
Ray.

1128
01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.160
Shit.

1129
01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.290
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1130
01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:42.333
It's okay.

1131
01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.379
You all right?

1132
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:46.090
Where's Mickey?

1133
01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:53.507
Camilla has him
in the other room.

1134
01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.138
Is she hurt?

1135
01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:56.183
I don't think so.

1136
01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:57.184
Good.

1137
01:04:57.852 --> 01:04:58.852
Anyone else here?

1138
01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.013
No.

1139
01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.065
Good.

1140
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.016
Where's Laurie's body?

1141
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:08.272
Lower level.

1142
01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:09.321
Okay.

1143
01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:13.323
On the phone, you knew
she was our liaison.

1144
01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:15.535
I did.

1145
01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:16.537
How did you know that?

1146
01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:18.074
Mickey told me.

1147
01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:20.410
Said she'd be stopping
by today at some point.

1148
01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:21.574
- No.
- Yeah.

1149
01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:23.083
He never woulda said that.

1150
01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:24.460
Why's that?

1151
01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:25.864
He didn't know
she was coming by.

1152
01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.004
And...

1153
01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:29.540
He doesn't trust you.

1154
01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:33.048
Come on.

1155
01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:36.260
Mr. Bauer, why would
he tell you to call me?

1156
01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:43.095
Get it together,
Mr. Bauer, okay?

1157
01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:44.605
We have to get outta here.

1158
01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:45.890
Where's the other bedroom?

1159
01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:52.030
It's this way.

1160
01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:53.073
Perfect.

1161
01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:12.542
Mrs. Bauer, my name's Paulie.

1162
01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:15.337
I'm here to get you and your
husband out of here safely.

1163
01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:17.431
Where's my husband?

1164
01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:22.218
Oh, right.

1165
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.102
He's in the other room.

1166
01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:25.558
Don't worry about Mickey.

1167
01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:27.564
Someone's gonna take
care of him, okay?

1168
01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:28.609
Let's go.

1169
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:31.069
Ray?

1170
01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:32.946
Ray!

1171
01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:37.442
They said no guns.

1172
01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:52.084
No, no, no!

1173
01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:53.214
No, no, no, no.

1174
01:06:53.259 --> 01:06:54.750
Please tell me he isn't dead.

1175
01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:55.802
Not yet.

1176
01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.963
And you won't be
for a while either.

1177
01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:05.474
The Fratellis want their
money back, all of it.

1178
01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:09.515
Your husband was messing
around with those accounts.

1179
01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:10.567
I don't understand.

1180
01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.572
Yeah you do.

1181
01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:20.075
You were supposed to be
a part of our protection.

1182
01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:20.953
We paid you.

1183
01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:21.954
You paid me?

1184
01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:24.373
No.

1185
01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.742
The Fratellis are the
agency's biggest client.

1186
01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:31.162
We've been on it
since the beginning.

1187
01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:32.830
You think it was
just a coincidence

1188
01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.919
that you got sent here
with someone like Mickey?

1189
01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:38.881
- But he...
- He what?

1190
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.671
That fucking guy's
one scotch away

1191
01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.009
from having a heart attack.

1192
01:08:18.803 --> 01:08:19.803
I know.

1193
01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:23.432
The fear.

1194
01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:25.800
It's setting in, right?

1195
01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:28.770
Knowing...

1196
01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:33.853
That your life is
almost over, huh?

1197
01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:40.532
I'll tell you what.

1198
01:08:41.909 --> 01:08:44.993
I'll give you one
more selfless act.

1199
01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.824
You tell me where the money is

1200
01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:57.878
and I will make sure that
I kill your husband quick.

1201
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.086
Where is?

1202
01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:03.578
What do you
consider quick, huh?

1203
01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:22.611
You motherfucker!

1204
01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.113
You fucking stupid bitch!

1205
01:09:41.177 --> 01:09:43.214
I don't need both of you.

1206
01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:48.517
Hey, dickless.

1207
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.066
That's what you get
for that mustache.

1208
01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:11.998
The Fratellis, the agency;
they used them, Mickey.

1209
01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:16.539
Probably sent me down
here to get me whacked too

1210
01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.374
so they don't have
to pay my pension.

1211
01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:22.007
So, what do we do now, Mickey?

1212
01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:26.716
Always with the
questions with you, huh?

1213
01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:30.015
I'll tell you what you do.

1214
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.846
You have that money, right?

1215
01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:40.058
You take your
mother, you vanish.

1216
01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:43.487
New names, you get off the grid.

1217
01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:44.942
It's gonna be your only shot.

1218
01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:49.651
I know a guy, pay him well.

1219
01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:52.621
He'll make you disappear.

1220
01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:55.119
And what about you?

1221
01:10:58.379 --> 01:10:59.870
Consider me retired.

1222
01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:01.965
Oh, and Ray.

1223
01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:03.999
Yeah?

1224
01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:05.451
I'm gonna need
something from you.

1225
01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.595
Yeah, anything.

1226
01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:31.411
Yeah.

1227
01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:32.454
Yeah, what?

1228
01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.407
It's been a week.

1229
01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:38.621
All right, four days.

1230
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:40.376
Don't get fucking cute with me!

1231
01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:44.210
This shit does not happen in
this business, you understand?!

1232
01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:45.544
It gives us a bad name!

1233
01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.050
It makes us look bad!

1234
01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:49.844
How the hell should I know?!

1235
01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:53.633
He's probably lying in a
ditch somewhere, he's drunk.

1236
01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:55.596
Probably doesn't even
know what's happening.

1237
01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.102
Find the, find the...

1238
01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.415
Would you just shut up for one...

1239
01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:01.603
Find the couple and find him!

1240
01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.062
And when you do find him,

1241
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.772
you put a bullet in
his fucking head!

1242
01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:06.904
Fuck.

1243
01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:07.906
Fuck!

1244
01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:10.659
Hey, Mickey.

1245
01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.159
Here, I thought we
were friends, Carl.

1246
01:12:17.959 --> 01:12:19.200
Don't act fuckin' surprised.

1247
01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:20.663
You know it is business.

1248
01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:23.920
You know the kinda
people we work with.

1249
01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:24.965
No, I didn't.

1250
01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:29.050
I thought we were doing good
most of the time, you know?

1251
01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:31.303
Protecting people.
- Really?

1252
01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.283
I mean, I know you ran
collections every now and then,

1253
01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:35.890
but I never put two
and two together.

1254
01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:38.928
I didn't know you did
collections for the Fratellis.

1255
01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:42.473
I mean, I'm smart, but
that one got by me.

1256
01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.935
You know they're
gonna come after you.

1257
01:12:45.987 --> 01:12:47.569
You know they
won't let you live.

1258
01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:51.071
I don't think they're
gonna have much of a choice.

1259
01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:54.948
See, a friend of mine gave
me this little black book

1260
01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:59.115
and it has all these
names, dates, transactions,

1261
01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:01.158
pretty much everything.

1262
01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.648
Had he paid attention
to those names,

1263
01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:06.083
he would've found
yours in there,

1264
01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:07.623
but he didn't care
about that, did he?

1265
01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.833
All he cared about was keeping
himself and his wife alive.

1266
01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:14.842
Anyway, I gave that
book to the feds.

1267
01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:18.471
So, I'd say your
friends, the Fratellis,

1268
01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.562
I'd say they're getting
picked up right about now,

1269
01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:23.973
along with their associates.

1270
01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:26.524
Only a matter of time

1271
01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.329
before they come knocking
on your door, Carl.

1272
01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:32.943
So, what do we do now?

1273
01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:35.452
I told you.

1274
01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:37.410
Last job and I'm done.

1275
01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:42.699
It was almost paradise, Carl,

1276
01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.417
right down to the
goddamn coconut.

1277
01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:35.737
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Bauer!

1278
01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:38.239
Do you like getting
shot in the pool?

1279
01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:40.526
Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Bauer!

1280
01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:46.661
Yeah, right in the fuckin' head!

1281
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:49.998
So, I'm gonna be
like, and that's when...

1282
01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.163
Okay,
which line is this?

1283
01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:06.388
- Nice, buddy.
- Are you all right?

1284
01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:08.707
This is gonna be
the nostril shot.

1285
01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:12.544
I still hear
some kind of fan running

1286
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.025
if anyone's nearby.

1287
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:16.357
It's definitely a fan.

1288
01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.067
There is definitely a fan.

1289
01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:19.697
Is this beard new?

1290
01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:20.778
What the fuck?

1291
01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:22.112
Hey, you know what happened?

1292
01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:23.902
I got a proctology exam.

1293
01:16:23.954 --> 01:16:25.348
It's the third time that
I'm having it right now.

1294
01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:27.364
- Is it?
- Absolutely.

1295
01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.703
I'd rather have my ass
checked out every day

1296
01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:34.713
than to walk into...

1297
01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:37.708
Holding onto me, still.

1298
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.002
You'd rather have your
ass checked every day?

1299
01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:42.171
Every day, with a cattle prod.

1300
01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:43.223
By?

1301
01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.426
Everyone.

1302
01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:45.307
Everyone?

1303
01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:46.641
The world.

1304
01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:47.519
All day long?

1305
01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.520
Every day.

1306
01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:50.895
I love you.

1307
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:54.149
Oh, it's so good
to see you, Mick.

1308
01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:56.059
Get off of me.

1309
01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:57.774
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1310
01:16:57.822 --> 01:16:58.903
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1311
01:16:58.948 --> 01:16:59.824
Yeah.

1312
01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.907
Well, at least it won't smell.

1313
01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:15.295
These fuckin' vines.

1314
01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:16.955
Lots of vines.

1315
01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:19.124
How many motorcycle
accidents are there a year?

1316
01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:20.838
A day?

1317
01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:21.846
How many motorcycle
accidents are there in a day?

1318
01:17:21.847 --> 01:17:23.587
A lot; I betcha a lot.

1319
01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:24.950
Why is everybody on
their cell phones?

1320
01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:26.761
They should be working.

1321
01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:27.809
Making some money.

1322
01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:30.427
What the fuck?

1323
01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:31.936
Jesus Christ!

1324
01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.392
Is there clean water here?

1325
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.102
You got clean water, right?

1326
01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:36.517
This isn't a smooth ride.

1327
01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.228
Jesus Christ.

1328
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.277
I have a neck, you know.

1329
01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.428
Hopefully, whoever you have
in the back isn't breakable

1330
01:17:45.452 --> 01:17:46.613
because something broke.

1331
01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:50.080
It's not my fault.

1332
01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:52.207
My hemorrhoids just popped out.

1333
01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:53.708
How much further do we got?

1334
01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:55.744
Why do I feel like
I'm talking to myself?

1335
01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:59.251
'Cause I am talking to myself.

1336
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.757
Take one, mark.

1337
01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:02.542
Where'd that wind come from?

1338
01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:04.211
Action!

1339
01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:07.843
Look what happened.

1340
01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:09.554
Sorry, no, I forgot...

1341
01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:11.264
They're gonna decorate

1342
01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:12.102
their next Christmas tree...

1343
01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:14.596
What?

1344
01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:15.980
What?

1345
01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.061
Is that gunshots?

1346
01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:18.378
What is that, did you hear that?

1347
01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:20.018
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Bauer.

1348
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:22.778
Do you like getting
shot in the pool?

1349
01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:24.109
Yes.

1350
01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.774
Action.

1351
01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:33.374
Let's go back.

1352
01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.740
I think you should
take the medication.

1353
01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:37.868
Just give me
the goddamn pills.

1354
01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:42.920
Don't touch me.

1355
01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:45.798
I hate you.
